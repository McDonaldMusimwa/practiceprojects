        <p>Python is a popular general-purpose programming language that can be used for a wide variety of applications. It includes high-level data structures, dynamic typing, dynamic binding, and many more features that make it as useful for complex application development as it is for scripting or "glue code" that connects components together. It can also be extended to make system calls to almost all operating systems and to run code written in C or C++. Due to its ubiquity and ability to run on nearly every system architecture, Python is a universal language found in a variety of different applications.
        </p>
        <p>Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes.The programming language includes thousands of third-party modules available in the Python Package Index (PyPI). PyPI provides popular standards for different expertise, like Django for web development and NumPy, Pandas, and Mathplotlib for data science.</p>
        <p>There are several reasons why Python is a good choice as a programming language, depending on your perspective and background. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Those new to programming can benefit from Python's high level of abstraction. It is highly interactive and known for its "strong opinions" around specific syntax (including whitespace). Python, like other high-level languages, has a garbage collection process to manage memory or delete unused resources. A user can receive instant feedback from the interpreter by typing python on the command line or by using projects like JupyterLab if they want a browser-based development experience. Many users also appreciate that Python has a strict syntax enforced by the compiler, making it easy to have a single "right way" to write a program. </li>
          <li>Perhaps most importantly, Python has an enormous user community. Python's popularity is both a cause and an effect of its community. It was the #1 programming language in 2018, according to the IEEE Spectrum ranking, and it is the #1 "Most Wanted" and #2 "Most Loved" language, according to StackOverflow's 2019 Developer Survey. Pythonistas, as members of the community call themselves, meet around the world in thousands at PyCon conferences.

This means that no matter what problem you're trying to solve, chances are there are already strong people working on a solution. Chances are also good that they have shared code, documentation, tutorials, and examples to help program a solution in Python. There are numerous IDEs and other development tools to choose from, and thousands of open source packages available to extend Python to do just about anything you can think of.</li>

      <article><p>'Variables are a container that you can store any sort or kind of data in.Imagine a varible as a warehouse ,as big as it is you can store anything from cars,food,furniture etc.Variables works the same way ,they are a warehouse in your programming that you can store anything and all sorts of data types.To declare a varible in python you will have to:'</p>
        <codec class="code">
          <p>variable=()</p>

      <header>Data Types</header>
      <article>
        <p>In programming, data type is an important concept.

        Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

        Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:</p>
        <p>String</p>
        <code class="code">string_example="Hello"</code>
        <p>Interger</p>
        <code class="code">int_example=5</code>
        <p>Float</p>
        <code class="code">float_example=5.4</code>
        <p>Lists</p>
        <code class="code">x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]</code>
        <p>Dictionaries</p>
        <code class="code">x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36}</code>
        <p>Complex</p>
        <code class="code">x = 1j</code>
        <p>Turple</p>
        <code class="code">x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")</code>

        <p>Python supports decision making code or what is code conditional statements.If statements gives your programme the ability to make dicisions:</p>
        <code class="code">
          <p>a = 33</p>
          <p>b = 200</p>
          <p>if b > a:</p>
           <p> print("b is greater than a")</p>
